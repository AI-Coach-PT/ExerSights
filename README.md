# ExerSights

AI-powered application for fitness & rehab, providing real-time feedback on exercise form using state of the art computer vision models. Track, correct, and improve your exercise form for safer, smarter, and more effective workouts.

## Summary

This project aims to develop a web application to assess physical therapy techniques and athletic movements with computer vision. Key concepts of this project are integrating human pose detection models with video data that can accurately, efficiently, and constantly identify the user's current body position, as well as provide real-time feedback and guidance for the user to maintain the correct form during different physical activities, based on physiological literature. Our application will feature a catalog of exercises that users can quickly navigate to select their desired exercise and immediately start making improvements simply by activating their device camera. With a successful implementation of the application, it will positively impact fitness, physical therapy, and rehabilitation by improving exercise safety and effectiveness.
